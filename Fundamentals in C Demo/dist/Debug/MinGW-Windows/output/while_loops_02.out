Let's play a guessing game!  Pick two integers.
I'll pick one in between them.
I'll give you 3 guesses to figure out my integer!
Let's go!!!

Please enter the minimum integer value
Please enter the maximum integer value
Please guess the value that I have picked!
Try #1 of 3
Nope! Number is too low!
Please guess the value that I have picked!
Try #2 of 3
Nope! Number is too low!
Please guess the value that I have picked!
Try #3 of 3
Nope! Number is too low!
You did not guess correctly within the number of tries :( the correct number is 8 ... Wanna play again?
