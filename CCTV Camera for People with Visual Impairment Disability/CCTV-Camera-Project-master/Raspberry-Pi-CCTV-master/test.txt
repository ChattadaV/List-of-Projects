THE BIG SLEEP
by Raymond Chandler

It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not
shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was
wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display
handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on
them.
